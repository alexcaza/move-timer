# move-timer

An Electron based menu app for the 20-8-2 timer

# Why this timer?

I first heard about this method from a WheezyWaiter video where he mentioned a working method that helped save his back from pain after long hours of sitting.

The rules are simple: sit for 20 minutes, stand for 8 minutes, take a break and walk around for 2 minutes. Repeat.

I wanted a timer on my computer that would help remind me to switch between positions since I was tired of using a custom interval timer on my phone. I couldn't find a desktop timer that would allow me to do this, so I whipped up my own.

# TODO

[] Break out states into own file with better structure
[] Share state with renderer in a clearer way
[] Split up index.html into proper files
[] Add sounds + sound toggle
[] Add quit button
[] Start tracking stats and write out to file along with settings
